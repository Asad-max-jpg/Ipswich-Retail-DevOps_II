                                Ipswich Retail was born from a desire to capture the ephemeral beauty of moments and memories in a bottle. Founded in London, our journey began with a simple philosophy: to create extraordinary scents from the finest ingredients on earth. We travel the globe to source rare florals, exotic spices, and precious woods, ensuring that every drop in our perfumes is of the highest quality.

With over 30 years of experience, her nose is our most valuable asset. Eleanor sees perfumery not just as a science, but as a story. She meticulously blends each note to compose a harmonious symphony, a fragrance that evolves on the skin and tells a unique tale for every wearer.</p>
